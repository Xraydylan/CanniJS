Battle
The battle is turn based. The initiative value determines how goes first.
Each round you can either use an attack, an item or compare your stats to the enemy stats.

These are the 4 main attacks:

strike/st:
This is your normal balanced attack.


brute force/br:
The brute force attack is stronger attack, but it decreases you initiative.


charge/ch:
You can charge for a big attack for a following turn.
You can charge for how many turns you want.
While you are charging you can only continue to charge or unleash your attack.


release/re:
To unleash your charged attack.


disrupt/dis:
The disrupt attack is a weaker attack, but it increases you initiative.
A disrupt attack can disrupt an enemies charge and cause damage proportional to the charged rounds.
Don´t forget: Enemies can disrupt you as well.


You can also try to use an item.
Use item/i to look at your items. Type the number of the item to use it.
If you don´t want to use any item leave the item menu with back/b.


During battle you can also compare your stats to the enemy stats with data/d.
This will not take up the round.
