Battle
Battles are turn based. The *initiative* value determines who goes first.
You can choose to attack, use an item, or compare your stats to the enemy's stats during each round.

These are the 4 main attacks:

strike/st:
This is your regular attack, which grands you a defense bonus.


brute force/br:
The **Brute force** attack is a stronger attack, but it decreases you initiative.


charge/ch:
You can charge energy for a big attack that can be unleashed during a future turn.
You can charge for as many turns as you please.
After using the charge command you can only choose to continue charging or to unleash your charged attack.


release/re:
Unleashes your **charge attack**.


disrupt/dis:
The **Disrupt attack** is a weaker attack, but it increases your initiative.
The disrupt attack can interrupt an enemy's charge. When interrupted, the enemy suffers damage proportional to their charge level.
Keep in mind that enemies can disrupt you as well.


You can also use an item.
Use item/i to look at your items. Type the number of an item to use it.
If you don't want to use any item, you can leave the item menu with back/b.


During battle you can compare your stats to the enemy's stats with data/d.
This will not end your turn.
