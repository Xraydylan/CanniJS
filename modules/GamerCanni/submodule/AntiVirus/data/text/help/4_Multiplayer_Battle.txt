Multi Player Battle
To setup a multi player battle you have to use the command
multi scan/msc

Now any number of other players can join the multi player battle by typing the same command.

A player can leave the multi player battle with the command
cancel/c

Once enough players gathered together, any player can use the start/s command to try and start the multi player battle.
You will be asked to confirm the start.

Now per player a monster according to the players strength will be spawned.
The general battle mechanics remain the same as those in the single player battle.

Except you have to specify a target for the attacks strike, brute force, disrupt and the moves release and data.
You do this by writing the the respective number of the enemy after the attack.
(Example: strike 1)

When using an item the same exception applies in a similar way.
Choose an item by writing the respective number. Then you will be asked for a target.

The round will be executed after every alive player choose a move.

If you are successful and win the generated loot will be equally distributed.
In multi player battles there is a bonus per player added in the generated loot.

(The same mechanics apply for the multi grind command.)
