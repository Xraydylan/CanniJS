Level Up
Once you gather enough experience points you level up.
Each time you level up, you'll get stat points which you can use to increase your base stats (attack, defence, initiative).

You can check your remaining stat points using the info/i command in the main menu.

To spend your stat points use:
use points/up

This will show you your base stats.

To spend one of your points, use:
attack/atk  or  defense/def  or  initiative/init to assign it to these stats respectively.

If you want to cancel assigning stat points, use:
back/b
