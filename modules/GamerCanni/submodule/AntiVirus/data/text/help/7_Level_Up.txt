Level Up
Once you gather enough experience points you level up.
Per level up you get status points which you can use to increase your base stats (attack, defense, initiative).

You can check with info/i in the main menu if you have any unused status points.

To start spending your status points use:
use points/up

Then you´ll see your base stats.

To spend one of your points use:
attack/atk  or  defense/def  or  initiative/init

If you want to go back before you´ve spent your status points use:
back/b
