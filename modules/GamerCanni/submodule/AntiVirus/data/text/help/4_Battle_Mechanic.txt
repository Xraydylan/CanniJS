Battle Mechanic
As you know the battle system is turn based.

It generally works as follows:

At the beginning of each round the moves of the players (and of the enemies in the background) are selected.
Than depending on the attack a modifier on the initiative value is applied for this round.

The battle order is determined by a comparison of the initiative values. If the initiative are equal than the order is randomly decided.

The attacks are then processed after one another.

The general formula for your normal battle damage is:

damage = (base attack + direct damage of weapon + a random value from 0 to the damage of weapon) - defense of enemy

Your total direct damage is:
base attack + direct damage of weapon

Your total hit damage is:
hit damage of weapon

For each of the different attacks a this formula is modified.

Generally the modifications are as follows:

Strike
--> Normal attack.
--> generates a defense bonus for the incoming enemy attack according your defence.

Brute Force
--> reduces your initiative.
--> adds a bonus to according to your base attack.

Disrupt
--> adds a bonus to your initiative.
--> reduces your damage according to your LV.
--> adds a small bonus to your damage according to your initiative.

Charge
--> damage of charges + 1 normal attacks with small bonus and half enemy defense each are calculated. This minus enemy defense is the total damage to the enemy.
