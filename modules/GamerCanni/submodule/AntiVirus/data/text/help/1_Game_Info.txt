You are a member of it and your job is it to defeat dangerous digital threats in turn based combat.
At your sign up you were given your first weapon but with enough Canni Coins (CC) you will soon be able to buy better and stronger ones.
You will receive more CC when you defeat an enemy in combat along with experience points.
With enough experience points can level up and get access to more and better shops.
Keep in mind as you get stronger, you will encounter stronger opponents.
